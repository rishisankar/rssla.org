                    Committees are a way for members of the Regents Scholar Society to become more involved with
                    the RSS community and take on a leadership role within the society. Our committees shape the
                    direction of our society: committee members help organize events and activities, raise funds,
                    work on design projects for the society, and much more!
                    <p/>
                    Each committee is led by
                    one or more board members and will meet regularly and have socials to help members get to know 
                    one another and engage with RSS.
